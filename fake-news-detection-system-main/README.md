📰 Fake News Detection System

A multi-stage Fake News Detection System that evaluates the authenticity of news articles using a structured compartment-based analysis approach. The system processes user-submitted content and provides a final verdict based on reliability, legitimacy, and trustworthiness.

Features
Stage 1: Quick Authenticity Filter
Checks source credibility
Evaluates content quality
Filters spam or low-quality inputs

 Stage 2: Preprocessing & Data Extraction
Extracts text, metadata, keywords
Prepares content for deeper analysis

Compartment-Based Analysis
C1 – Relatability
Checks contextual relevance (location, time, plausibility)
C2 – Legitimacy
Compares with trusted sources
Measures similarity and cross-references
C3 – Trustworthiness
Evaluates bias, factual consistency, and source reliability
Score Calculation


Weighted scoring system:

Final Score = 
0.55 × Legitimacy +
0.30 × Relatability +
0.15 × Trustworthiness
🏁 Final Verdict
VERIFIED
SUSPICIOUS

How It Works
User submits news content (text or URL)

Stage 1 filters low-quality or suspicious input

Stage 2 processes and extracts key information

Content is analyzed across three compartments
Scores are calculated using weighted formulas
Final verdict is generated and displayed

 Example Output
{
  "relatabilityScore": 65,
  "legitimacyScore": 78,
  "trustworthinessScore": 40,
  "finalScore": 68,
  "verdict": "SUSPICIOUS"
}

Objectives
Detect misleading or false information
Provide explainable scoring instead of black-box results
Improve reliability of news consumption
Support users in critical evaluation of content

Future Improvements
Real-time fact-checking integration
Advanced NLP-based contextual analysis
User feedback learning system
Dashboard for analytics and trends
